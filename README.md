# 3D-Model-Generation-using-Natural-Language

## TODOs
- [] Setup CodeLlama-70B. Preferrably in one AWS instance. (Setup through Ollama?). API calling is preferred.
- [] Develop PyAutoGUI code. Minimum (None preferrably) mouse movements or relative position movements to increase generality.
- [] Decide on a strong captioning model. Check its performance on random CAD models.
- [] Sample 200-300 CAD images from the ABC dataset and manually annotate (image-caption pair dataset).
- [] Finetune the captioning model with the sampled dataset.
- [] Integrate code generation, PyAutoGUI, and captioning feedback.
- [] Manual testing and refinement of prompts and hyperparameters.
- [] Create a benchmark dataset and test the entire system.
